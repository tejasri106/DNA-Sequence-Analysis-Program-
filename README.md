# DNA-Sequence-Analysis-Program-
Overview
The DNA Sequence Analysis project is a Java-based application that performs basic bioinformatics tasks on DNA sequences. This beginner-friendly tool is designed for students and enthusiasts to explore DNA data through programming while gaining insights into genetic information.

**Features**:

Validation of DNA Sequences
Ensures the input contains only valid nucleotide characters (A, T, C, G).

Counting Nucleotides
Calculates the frequency of each nucleotide in a sequence.

CG Ratio Calculation
Determines the proportion of cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides to the total length of the DNA sequence.

Complementary Sequence Generator
Produces the complementary strand of DNA by pairing nucleotides (A ↔ T, C ↔ G).

**Technologies Used**

Java: Core programming language.
JUnit: (Optional) For unit testing.
Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA: Recommended IDE for development.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites:
JDK 8 or higher.
Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or similar).

**Installation**

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/dna-sequence-analysis.git
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

**Running the Application**

Compile and run the main program:
DNALoops.java

Input Example:
Enter a DNA sequence: ATCGATTGAGCTCTAGCG
Outputs include nucleotide counts, CG ratio, and complementary sequence.

**Usage**

This tool is perfect for:
Learning bioinformatics concepts.
Practicing Java programming with real-world applications.
Exploring basic genetic sequence operations.

**Future Enhancements**

Add support for RNA sequence analysis.
Implement graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
Introduce advanced bioinformatics features like motif finding or sequence alignment.
